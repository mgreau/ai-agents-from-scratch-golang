# AI Agents Framework Tutorial - Go Edition

Welcome to the step-by-step tutorial for building your own AI agent framework in Go!

This tutorial teaches you to build a **lightweight, educational AI agent framework** with the same core concepts as LangChain, but with simpler implementations designed for learning.

Instead of diving into complex framework codebases, you'll rebuild key patterns yourself with clear, educational Go code. By the end, you'll understand what frameworks are actually doing, making you far more effective at using them.

**What you'll implement:**
- Runnable interface (composability pattern)
- Message types (structured conversations)
- LLM wrappers (model integration)
- Tools system (function calling)
- Agents (decision-making loops)
- Advanced patterns (chains, memory, graphs)

**What makes this different:**
- Go-idiomatic implementations
- Type-safe with interfaces
- Concurrency with goroutines
- Real, working code (not pseudocode)
- Educational focus (understanding over completeness)

Build it yourself. Understand it deeply. Use frameworks confidently.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Start Here)

Work through the examples in order:

1. **[01_intro](../examples-go/01_intro/)** - Basic LLM interaction
2. **[03_translation](../examples-go/03_translation/)** - System prompts
3. **[04_think](../examples-go/04_think/)** - Reasoning
4. **[05_batch](../examples-go/05_batch/)** - Parallel processing with goroutines
5. **[06_coding](../examples-go/06_coding/)** - Streaming with channels
6. **[07_simple-agent](../examples-go/07_simple-agent/)** - Tools and function calling
7. **[09_react-agent](../examples-go/09_react-agent/)** - ReAct pattern

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (Advanced)

Learn the architecture by building components:

1. **[01-core-patterns](01-core-patterns/)** - Runnable, Messages, Context
2. **[02-llm-integration](02-llm-integration/)** - LLM wrapper patterns
3. **[03-tools-system](03-tools-system/)** - Building custom tools
4. **[04-agent-patterns](04-agent-patterns/)** - Agent architectures
5. **[05-advanced-concepts](05-advanced-concepts/)** - Memory, chains, graphs

## 📖 Recommended Reading Order

### Week 1-2: Basics
- Run all examples in examples-go/
- Read pkg/core/ implementations
- Understand Runnable pattern

### Week 3-4: Tools & Agents
- Study pkg/tools/ and pkg/agents/
- Implement custom tools
- Build a simple agent

### Week 5-6: Advanced
- Complete advanced tutorials
- Implement memory systems
- Build chains and graphs

### Week 7-8: Project
- Build a complete application
- Deploy to production
- Optimize performance

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Complete setup first (see QUICKSTART_GO.md)
make deps
make build

# 2. Run examples to understand concepts
make run-intro
make run-agent
make run-react

# 3. Study the implementations
cd pkg/core
# Read runnable.go, message.go, context.go

# 4. Try advanced tutorials
cd tutorial-go/01-core-patterns
# Follow the README.md
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Understand before implementing** - Read the concept first
2. **Type the code yourself** - Don't just copy/paste
3. **Break things** - Experiment to learn
4. **Read error messages** - Go's compiler helps you learn
5. **Use the debugger** - Step through code to understand flow
6. **Write tests** - Verify your understanding
7. **Ask questions** - Check issues or discussions
